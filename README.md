This project is a 3D animated scene created using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library used for 3D rendering and animation on the web. The scene contains six different 3D models: an animated cylinder, an animated diamond, an animated sphere, a box with a texture, an iPhone model, and a letter block model. Multiple lighting effects have been added to enhance the appearance of the objects.

## Prerequisites

To run this project on your local machine, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. You also need a modern web browser that supports WebGL.

## Installation

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd three.js-animated-elemnents
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
